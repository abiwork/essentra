# CommunityStarter

This Maven project is a Spring boot implementation of a community [Broadleaf Commerce](http://www.broadleafcommerce.org) application. It has many sensible defaults set up along with examples of how a fully functioning eCommerce site based on Broadleaf might work.

## Project Overview

The Community Demo is comprised of 4 individual projects:

```shell
~/CommunityDemo » tree -L 1
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── admin
├── api
├── core
├── pom.xml
└── site
```

- `admin` - a Spring Boot application for the Broadleaf admin for catalog management, see completed orders, etc
- `api` - a Spring Boot application that sets up the Broadleaf API endpoints
- `site` - a Spring Boot application that runs the Heat Clinic UI built with Thymeleaf as traditional MVC
- `core` a common jar that all other projects depend on, used for common functionality like domain

## Running the projects

You must first do a `mvn package` or `mvn install` from the root to build all of the projects:

```shell
~/CommunityDemo » mvn clean install
```

After this completes you can run either `site`, `api` or `admin` by using the Spring Boot Maven plugin with `mvn spring-boot:run`. Example:

```shell
~/CommunityDemo » cd site
~/CommunityDemo/site » mvn spring-boot:run

```

If you have a JRebel license you can use the `jrebel` profile to start with the Jrebel agent, using a `jrebel.agent.args` property. Example on OSX:

```shell
mvn spring-boot:run -Pjrebel -Djrebel.agent.args='-agentpath:/full/path/to/jrebel/lib/libjrebel64.dylib'
```

We recommend moving the `jrebel.agent.args` property into your global `~/.m2/settings.xml` file so that you can just start the application with:

```shell
mvn spring-boot:run -Pjrebel
```

For more information on which agent to use for your operating system, [consult the Jrebel documentation](https://manuals.zeroturnaround.com/jrebel/standalone/springboot.html#springboot).
